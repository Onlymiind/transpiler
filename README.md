## About

This is a work-in-progress implementation of custom compiled general-purpose language. Lexer and parser are currently considered finished, although some additions/refactoring will be needed in the future. The type checker in partially implemented. The desing of the language is a WIP, and is formulated alongside compiler implementation (some syntax sketches can be found in desing_doc.md).
